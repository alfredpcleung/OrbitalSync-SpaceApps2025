# OrbitalSync — Prototype Dashboard

**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**  
**Local Award:** Winner, Toronto (Global Connection)

---

## Prototype Overview

This repository contains our hackathon prototype: a **live 3D radar screen of Earth**.

- Each dot represents a satellite, color‑coded by orbit.  
- Users can click to view satellite details.  
- Orbits can be toggled on/off.  
- Time can be fast‑forwarded to visualize orbital motion.  

The current demo shows ~50 satellites, but the system is designed to scale to thousands — all displayed on one trusted, shared screen.

## Purpose

The prototype demonstrates how OrbitalSync could provide operators, insurers, and regulators with a **clear, consolidated view of orbital activity**. It is a proof‑of‑concept for a neutral platform that improves situational awareness and lowers barriers for smaller operators.
